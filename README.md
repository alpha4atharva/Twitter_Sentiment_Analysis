# <span style="font-size:larger;">Twitter Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression</span>

This repository contains Python code for sentiment analysis on Twitter data using logistic regression. The aim is to classify tweets into different sentiment categories such as positive, negative, or neutral.

# <span style="font-size:larger;">Key Features:</span>
Data Preprocessing:
The code preprocesses the Twitter data by converting text to lowercase, removing emojis, and special characters.

Stopword Removal:
Implements stopwords removal to eliminate common words that do not carry much meaning.

Tokenization:
Tokenizes the cleaned text to break down the sentences into individual words.

TF-IDF Vectorization:
Utilizes TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical format for machine learning model training.

Logistic Regression Model:
Implements a logistic regression model to classify the sentiment of tweets.

Model Evaluation:
Evaluates the model performance using accuracy score and classification report.


# <span style="font-size:larger;">Results:</span>
The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 91.928% on the test dataset. Detailed classification report including precision, recall, and F1-score for each sentiment category is provided in the code output.
